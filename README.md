# Movies-App

I made this project to learn react. Things like, forms, form-validation, talking to the api etc. You may find the code whaky because it is my first real project. You can find Node.js api [here](https://github.com/hubcio2115/movies-app-backend/tree/master). Do whatever you want with it if you need it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn preview`

Runs app in the preview server.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
